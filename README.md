# password_checker
---A Python3 script---
Required installed Python packages: requests -- https://pypi.org/project/requests/
This was a scripting excercise for me, which I did during a Udemy course.
I welcome any feedback and pull requests. :) 

This script checks one or several passwords in the database of haveibeenpwned.com, seeing if the password had been leaked or breached in the past.
Good way to check if the password you are using is still secure or not.

Enter passwords either in the terminal (E.g: > check_pass.py hello password test <- this checks the passwords: hello, password, test)

Or you can list passwords in the "pass.txt" file, which must be in the same folder as this script (test file included). List passwords in new lines in the file.
